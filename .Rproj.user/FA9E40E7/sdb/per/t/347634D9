By using confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by `supp` and `dose`, we will study the impact of these two variables on tooth growth and present our conclusions, including the assumptions made.\n\n## Exploring the dataset\n\nIn this section, we will load the ToothGrowth dataset and perform some exploratory data analysis, before performing our hypothesis testing in the next section.\n\n```{r init}\n# Libraries\nlibrary(datasets)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Load data & basic data info\ndata(ToothGrowth)\nToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)\nsummary(ToothGrowth)\n```\n\nThe data represents 60 observations, with the length of teeth in each of 10 guinea pigs after following three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1 and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice OJ or ascorbic acid AC).\n\nWe'll now explore the data using some simple boxplots to get an idea if `supp` and `dose` have an impact on tooth length and in which way.\n\n```{r explo, fig.align='center'}\n# Plot length vs dose & supp\ng1 <- ggplot(aes(x = dose, y = len), data = ToothGrowth) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = dose))\ng2 <- ggplot(aes(x = supp, y = len), data = ToothGrowth) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp))\ngrid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol=2)\n\nggplot(aes(x = supp, y = len), data = ToothGrowth) + \n    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp)) + facet_wrap(~ dose)\n```\n\nIn the graphs above, we can see a clear trend: the larger the dosage, the longer the tooth. However, the effectiveness of delivery method is not clear, both OJ and VC have roughly the same performance (with OJ having a slightly higher mean).\n\nLooking at both variables together gives an interesting insight: it seems that at lower doses OJ is more effective than VC in terms of tooth length, but at high dosage (2mg), the performance is the same.\n\n## Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing\n\nThe objective of this section is to use confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to prove or disprove the null hypothesis (dosage/supplement have no impact on teeth length). To do so, we will use unpaired T-tests between factors of `dose` and `supp`.\n\n```{r ttestsupp}\ntt <- t.test(len ~ supp, paired = F, var.equal = F, data = ToothGrowth)\ntt\n```\n\nIn this T-test testing for supplements, while the means are different **(`r round(tt$estimate,2)`)**, we cannot disprove the null hypothesis as the probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining these means is over 5% (p value is **`r round(tt$p.value,3)`**). Therefore, we can conclude that supplement type **does NOT** have a statistically significant impact on teeth length within the given sample.\n\nIn order to use T tests on the `dose`, we must split the dataset into pairs of dosages.\n\n```{r ttestdose}\n    dose1 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 1.0))\n    dose2 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 2.0))\n    dose3 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(1.0, 2.0))\n    t1 <- t.test(len ~ dose, paired = F, var.equal = F, data = dose1)\n    t2 <- t.test(len ~ dose, paired = F, var.equal = F, data = dose2)\n    t3 <- t.test(len ~ dose, paired = F, var.equal = F, data = dose3)\n```\n\nThe p values for the T-tests are **`r t1$p.value`**, **`r t2$p.value`**, and **`r t3$p.value`**. Since these values are all under 0.05, we can disprove the null hypothesis and conclude that dosage **does** have a statistically significant impact on teeth length within the given sample.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nFor all these hypothesis tests, we are assuming that our guinea ping subjects represent a population that is IID (independant and identically distributed), and that:\n\n* The guinea pigs are repesentative of the whole population and follow a random sample.\n* Tooth length shows a normal distribution\n* Observations are independent of each other\n\n## Appendix\n\nThis analysis was completed with the below system:\n\n```{r session}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n",
